<h1>Objective</h1>
<p>A lesson objective can be one of the most important components of a lesson plan.<br> Objectives define what students are going to learn during the lesson and explain how the learning is going to be assessed. After you write the objective in the lesson plan, you can write it on the board the day of the lesson . <br>Teachers usually update objectives every day and review them with students so they know what goal they are striving to achieve.</p>
<p1>There are a few different formats you can use to write objectives.<br> Some explain the goal the student hopes to achieve from the teacher's perspective and others explain the objective from the student's perspective. <br>An effective objective includes a goal and a measurable form of assessment at the end of the lesson.<br> Here are a few examples for different subjects:</p1>
<h2>History</h2>
<p2>Students will show an understanding of the geographic influence on historical issues and events during World War II <br>by creating an objective summary of the events and how the geography of the events affected the war.</p2>
<h2>Math</h2>
<p2>By the end of the lesson, students will use addition and multiplication to complete four of the five sample problems correctly</p2>
<h2>Science</h2>
<p2>Today I will take notes on the scientific method so that I can apply them to an experiment. I'll know I've got it when I can list and explain each step as it applies to a provided experiment</p2>
