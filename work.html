    <h1>work</h1>
 <h2>   Education teacher</h2>
 <p2>   Physical education teachers can also be a well paid job, but there are still differences between in-service and non in-service physical education teachers. <br>
    Employed teachers are more stable, have good welfare benefits, and have less work environment pressure. <br>
    Non employed physical education teachers generally refer to teachers from private schools or institutions.<br>
     As private schools are generally responsible for their own profits and losses, they require high skills and work efficiency from teachers, resulting in a large workload.
<h3>    02
    coach</h3>
  <p3>  Among the various sports categories, there are various ball games such as basketball, volleyball, and football, as well as physical fitness and fitness coaches.<br>
     Sports students can become corresponding coaches or cross project coaches according to their majors.<br>
      And salaries such as tennis and football are very good, with most coaches earning over 10000 yuan per month.<p3>
   <h4> 03
    Healthcare and rehabilitation professionals</h4>
   <p4> In sports science, there are sports rehabilitation and human sports science,<br> as well as fitness majors, which can effectively learn human anatomy, massage techniques, and rehabilitation training methods. Because sports students are exposed to various types of sports for a long time, they have unique insights into sports rehabilitation. Moreover, sports rehabilitation majors can also obtain corresponding technician certificates and work in rehabilitation departments in hospitals.</p4>
   <h5> 04
    Self media</h5>
  <p5>  In the era of self media, dividends such as short videos and live streaming continue to rise.<br>
     Many sports students who teach sports online can become bloggers in a certain field, with varying incomes.</p5>
   <h6> 05
    Sports Journalist</h6>
    <p6>Of course, this is a specialized profession, and there are fewer universities that offer it. <br>At the same time, the threshold is relatively high, but it is a quite good profession.</p6>
  <h7>  06
    Divers, salvage workers</h7>
   <p7> Sports students can also work in diving related industries, salvage bureaus, and other related fields. <br>
    In the salvage bureau, they also enjoy a high income and have a well-developed equipment and technology, but there is still a slight risk coefficient.</p7>
    <h8>07
    Coach or marketer for outdoor expansion</h8>
   <p8> The outdoor expansion industry has only become popular in recent years.<br> In my memory, there have been relevant reports since 0708, but enterprises above designated size emerged around 10 years ago. After these large-scale enterprises emerged, there were many training and drills for outdoor expansion, live CS, and other outdoor sports projects in the market. These projects are not only enjoyed by enterprises, employees, some schools and families, but also by social organizations. Outdoor expansion has broad prospects and is just in the rapid growth period of the industry. It is a promising industry for students majoring in sports and a good field to break away from traditional employment directions.</p8>
